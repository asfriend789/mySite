  <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
    <p>I set up index.html and I linked it to the Bootstrap CSS and Javascript pages that I downloaded from GetBootstrap.com.  I also
      created a CSS stylesheet so that I could add more custom styles to my site.  To make sure that the sheets were connected, I gave
      the h2 a class of "main" and, in the stylessheet, I made the color of main "blue".  I tested in the browser and it worked. See SS1-3.
